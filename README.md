Our Pink October Awareness website is designed to promote breast cancer awareness through a user-friendly, interactive experience. With a weeb-themed approach, we aim to engage users in a modern and accessible way, while addressing an important health issue.

The website features three core sections:
Home Page: 
A welcoming space that introduces users to the theme of Pink October, highlighting the importance of early detection and awareness in the fight against breast cancer.

Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Quiz: 
This interactive quiz allows users to quickly assess their potential risk levelsâ€”categorized into Low, Moderate, or High. Upon completion, users receive personalized advice on preventive actions and next steps, encouraging proactive health management.

Survivor Stories: 
A deeply moving section where breast cancer survivors share their personal experiences. These stories provide hope, encouragement, and valuable insights, fostering a sense of community and support for both those affected and their loved ones.


The entire website is designed to be informative yet approachable, with simple navigation and accessible language to make important information easy to digest. Our goal is to raise awareness, offer resources for early detection, and create a supportive space for breast cancer survivors.
